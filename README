Instructions:
-----------------------------------------------------
Preparations
1. Open src/main/resources/config.properties. Set server addresses, port numbers and file pathes that you want to do grep.
2. We save grep results in local files everty time after greping. You may change the file path as you like.
3. Our project is built through maven. If you hava installed maven in your computer, you can easily package our project into executable jar files--client.jar 
or server.jar through setting different main classes.
-----------------------------------------------------
Run the server
1. Scp the server.jar into the servers that you want to use.
2. cd into the folder where you put the server.jar.
3. run the command: java -jar server.jar 8088. (Here, 8080 is the server port which should be consistent with the port number you set into config.properties)
-----------------------------------------------------
Run the client
1. cd into the folder of client.jar.
2. do distributed grep by the command: jave -jar client.jar grep [-option] regexps. (The second half of the command can be any legal grep command except for
the file address)
-------------------------------------------------------
UnitTest
1. You can run the function LogfileTest to generate some log files if you like.
2. We have gengerate some log files in local and save the results of different grep commands in local files named unit-test-outcome1.log, ..., unit-test-outcome4.log.
3. You need to manually scp the log files -UnitTest2.log,..,UnitTest6.log to servers.
4. Then you can run GrepUnitTest to do the unittest.
